## Modifications

Re-make cell filling lines (different Stycast)

## Results

* No leaks!
* Cryostat is working, but not very good (10mK base temperature, not stable)
* HE6 is most sensitive to vibrations
* Second themometer on HE10 shows too high temperature

* All wires are working except w2nm
* calibration of MCTA and W*TA are slightly different (9.5 vs 8 mK)
* Magnets are working (NMR=+1200, HS up to +/-4000mA, MC=+1500mA)
* HS shield is quenching, can't magnetize properly

* Main magnet inverted? Check! -- No.

## Measurements

* All wires vs drive and fied at vacuum, 10mK
* Wire measurements at 4K: all tantalum wires vs field, all cell wires vs pressure.

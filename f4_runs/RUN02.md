###  RUN2 18.03.2021 - 20.04.2021

## Modifications

First run with aerogel cell. Many modifications (new thermometer/heater wiring,
new 20mK radiation shield, niobium shields, modified pumping system).

## Results

All vibrating wires work. Problem with magnet wiring (heat connection
between Mix.Ch, 20mK plate and Still), lowest temperature ~20mK.
Measurements of vibrating wires in 4K and 20mK in vacum, filling cell.
Something strange with magnets/shields. No NMR signal. Run finished
because of cold leak.

Calibration tables

I use ordinary databases to keep big calibration tables for wibrating
wires. Each table contains resonance width instead of timestamp and pairs
<pressure>-<temperatuure> for pressures 0:1:30 bar.

Usage example can be found in ../w*ta:1 filters. For a given width the
whole <p>-<t> table is extracted, using linear interpolation from
graphene get command. Then table_lookup function from graphene tcl
library is used.

Note:
* "Timestamps" should be non-negative floatng point numbers without exponent.
* graphene_get in a database fiter can't get values from the same db.
* at the moment calling one filter from another (using graphene_get with filter)
  modifies timestamp and data - this is done to keep a single tcl interpreter
  and save time.
